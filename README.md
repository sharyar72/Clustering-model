# Clustering-model
This repository contains code and dataset to perform K-Means Clustering with 3 different baseline and evaluation matrix using purity
1. The first baseline uses TF based features.
2. The second baseline uses TF IDF based features
3. The third baseline uses Word2Vec embedding.

The code can be executed using main.py in the file just change the path of the Dataset where the clusters of the ground truth are available.
This can be used to score the 3 baselines with the purity metrics.
